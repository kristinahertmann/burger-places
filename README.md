## This is a test task for a Front-End position.

### Used: Angular [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript), [Burger API (1.0.0)](http://careers.qminder.com/senior-frontend-assignment/lambda-recognizer.html) and [Foursquare API](https://location.foursquare.com/developer/)

Map shows the city of Tartu's burger joints. A radius of 1km from Tartu Bussijaam is excluded and shown on the map with a circle. Clicking on a marker shows the burger restaurant name.

Images show burger joint pictures. Image shows pictures of burgers if a burger place has a picture like that (used Burger API (1.0.0) recognition) in case a burger joint doesn't have an image with a burger, then the first image is shown. Burger pictures are highlighted with a border.
